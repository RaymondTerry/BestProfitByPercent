# BestProfitByPercent
Takes API data from CoinMarketCap and computes the percentage of profit left until the predetermined target of an asset. 

To get the code functioning you need to get either your own api access or grab a key from https://coinmarketcap.com/api/ 

As the code was designed around CMC it will be the easiest. 

The assets and targets predefined are arbitary and can be replaced to anyones liking which means the appropriate code will also need to be replaced. The default ones are near my personal targets to suit my own needs. Of course, the code can be improved with the modular capabilities where any asset can be entered as an input but that was beyond the scope of my needs for this personal project. 

Although any improvements are welcome!
